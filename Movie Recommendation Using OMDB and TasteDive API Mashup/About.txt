A small movie recommendation project where we give a movie name and it returns 
similar movies sorted according to their ratings from various rating agencies 
and the public using the help of two API's OMDB and Tastedive.

The TasteDive API takes a movie (or bands, TV shows, etc.) as a query input,
and returns a set of related items. The OMDB API takes a movie title as a query input 
and get back data about the movie, including scores from various review sites (Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, etc.).
